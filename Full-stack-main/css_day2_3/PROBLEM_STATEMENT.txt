Exercise 3 — Display & Positioning

Goal:
Practice display modes (block, inline, inline-block) and basic positioning.

Tasks for students (write ONLY CSS, do not change HTML structure):
1) Convert the <a> links inside .vertical into vertical menu items by making them block-level.
2) Convert the <a> links inside .horizontal into horizontal menu items using inline-block.
3) Place the element with class 'login-btn' at the top-right corner of the header using absolute positioning.
4) Add spacing and hover states via CSS for better usability (optional).

Notes:
• Do not modify the HTML content or order.
• Use only CSS to achieve the required behaviors.
• If needed, you can give header a relative position so .login-btn can be placed against it.
